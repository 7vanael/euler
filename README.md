# Project Euler in Clojure

Project Euler ([http://projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net)) is an addictive and fun way to learn a new language.  This project is a stub for solving Euler problems using Clojure.  It'll generate spec and solution stubs in an organized fashion, making life just a little bit better.
